                    We are all for helping its clients save money. Going through the LOMA process
                    will allow FEMA and ultimately flood insurance companies to have a better
                    understanding of the flood risk your property faces. If you decide to keep
                    flood insurance, you can expect a significant reduction in your premium. Your
                    mortgage lender may also drop your flood insurance requirement all together.
                    However, you should learn more about your flood risk before making such
                    decision. We will guide you by providing a FREE Flood Analysis Memo with your
                    LOMA order.</p>

                    How Once you submit a request for us to handle your LOMA process, we will contact you to coordinate a time for a surveyor to come and survey your property. We then use the Elevation Certificate from the Surveyor to submit your LOMA application to FEMA and provide you with FEMAâ€™s reply. Depending on the situation, this entire process may take as little as 1 week or as long as 60 days. When you submit your request, No Flood Florida will give you your expected time and keep you updated along the way. </p>
