We are all for helping its clients save money. Going through the LOMA process
will allow FEMA and ultimately flood insurance companies to have a better
understanding of the flood risk your property faces. <b>If you decide to keep
flood insurance, you can expect a significant reduction in your premium. Your
mortgage lender may also drop your flood insurance requirement all together.</b>
However, you should learn more about your flood risk before making such
decision. We will guide you by providing a <b>FREE Flood Analysis Memo</b> with your
LOMA order.`

How Once you submit a request for us to handle your LOMA
process, we will contact you to coordinate a time for a
surveyor to come and survey your property. We then use the
Elevation Certificate from the Surveyor to submit your LOMA
application to FEMA and provide you with FEMAâ€™s reply.
  Depending on the situation, this entire process may take as
little as 1 week or as long as 60 days. When you submit
your request, No Flood Florida will give you your expected
time and keep you updated along the way.`

We screen every request prior
to beginning the process. Each property is ranked as either
having a low, medium, or high likelihood of receiving a
LOMA from FEMA. We will recommend the medium and high
likelihood properties to move forward. We will also work
with clients who received a low likelihood designation to
submit their request. If through our screening process we
find that you are almost certainly not going to be able to
get a LOMA, we will notify you. But you can rest assured
because our service has a money back guarantee!
